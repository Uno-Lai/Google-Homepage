# Google-Homepage
## Overview:
For this project, I will deconstruct the Google homepage and I will rebuild it using my knowledge of Html and CSS.

## Lessons Learned :
After completing this project I've learned just how important it is to know how to ask questions and communicate when you're stuck. During this project, there were many times that I didn't know how to fix a certain thing on the website. Instead of staring at the screen for hours, it's important to simply take to the web and its resources to find a solution.
